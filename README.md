# aRoulette
A simple graphical program to simulate a roulette used to randomly select students.

I created this program to implement a procedure to select students to solve problems in the blackboard. The main idea behind this procedure is that the probability of being selected is modified according to the results. When a student refuses to solve a problem, then its probability of being selected is increased. Conversely, when a student volunteers its probability of being selected is decreased. 

The probabilities are graphically shown as a biased roulette and the program simulates draws of the rulette; the simulation can be modified to through the parameters of the program.
